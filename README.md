Retro Racers is a simple racing game developed during Code Institute's August Hackathon, themed "Pixel Pioneers". It is a laptop/desktop game, whereby the car is controlled using a keyboard.

The live deployed site can be found [here](https://alanjameschapman.github.io/2408-hackathon-team5/).

Please use GitHub's burger bun to navigate between sections.

# Agile Development

The project was developed using Agile principles throughout. Minutes [here](#minutes "Minutes"). User stories were prioritized using MoSCoW, and the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was  identified for early deployment.

# User Experience

The five planes of User Experience were used to design the website. This is not a linear process - each plane was considered and developed throughout development.

## Strategy

Based on the Code Institute Hackathon August 2024 Theme of "Pixel Pioneers", the goal of this platform is to:
- Make a retro game complete with 8 bit sound effects and music.
- Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JS game framework such as Three.js.

Following an initial brainstorm of possible games, a plan-view racing game concept was chosen, similar to the original Micro-Machines video game, developed by Codemasters for the NES.

Needs of users were defined as user stories and managed via [GitHub Issues/Projects](https://github.com/users/alanjameschapman/projects/7).

## Scope

Once the game was chosen, existing online games were researched to help identify what would be included in the scope of the project. Possible features were identified and converted to user stories within GitHub projects.

## Structure

[Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com) was used to structure the site navigation as shown in the user flow diagram below. This was later developed into wireframes - see the Skeleton section.

## Skeleton

### Interface Design

A laptop-first approach was used, with subsequent layouts for larger screens developed thereafter.

#### Wireframe

A concept design was created during the brainstorming phase, showing possible track layout and game features for development.

<img width="717" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-17 at 13 18 48" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b711f6e0-8002-4871-b0e6-c28f136c8da9">

It was not necessary to create wireframes for such simple page layouts.

### Navigation Design

To give a retro feel and simple site layout, the home screen uses a gearshift image and links to each page. Each page has a link to return to the main menu only. following links: home, race, settings and high scores.

## Surface

### Colour schemes

The colour scheme is based on the NES of greys and red.

### Fonts

Press Start 2P from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P/about) was chosen to create an 80's arcade game feel and a feeling of nostalgia.

# Features

## Implemented

### Main menu (index.html)

The home page allows the user to navigate around the site using a retro-looking image of a gearshift. Users are greeted by 8 bit music which can be muted if preferred. This mutable music is present on every page.

# Testing

## Manual Testing

### User Stories

User Stories were tracked throughout the project as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/users/alanjameschapman/projects/5). Links are provided to see the development notes and screenshots for each.

### Responsiveness

The responsiveness to different screen sizes was checked throughout the project. Results for MVP and final site are shown below, the main visual difference being fonts.

<img width="947" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-19 at 11 41 59" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/599a2c12-650f-46d2-954e-d7573aba32f6">

### Browser Compatibility

Browser compatibility was tested using this [MDN guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Introduction) as a reference. The following was testing in each browser:
- Functionality, navigation and hyperlinks
- Responsiveness
- Aesthetics

### Bugs

Bugs were tracked throughout the project as GitHub issues.

### Lighthouse

The WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool was used throughout the project to check for accessibility issues. Lighthouse was then used to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the deployed site. The PWA score not showing is a [known feature](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60603960/why-lighthouse-pwa-score-is-blank-even-though-the-page-is-audited).

### Code Validation

#### HTML

[W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML.

<img width="756" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-19 at 13 00 12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14736afe-1fa3-491c-8d08-6589c1a1550f">

#### CSS

CSS was validated by direct input using [jigsaw W3C Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and validates as CSS level 3 + SVG:

<p>
    <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">
        <img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px"
            src="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss-blue"
            alt="Valid CSS!"/>
    </a>
</p>

#### JavaScript

[jshint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the only custom JavaScript file, [comments.js](/staticfiles/js/comments.js), used to edit, delete and approve comments.

| File | Screenshot | Description | Pass |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| [comments](/staticfiles/js/comments.js) | ![comments.js](/docs/testing/comments-js.png) | One warning about a function 'getCookie' declared in a loop referencing an outer scoped variable. Reviewed but syntax deemed not difficult to understand. | &check; |
