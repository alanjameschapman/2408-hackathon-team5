# Agile Development

The project was developed using Agile principles throughout. Minutes [here](#minutes "Minutes"). User stories were prioritized using MoSCoW, and the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was  identified for early deployment.

# User Experience

The five planes of User Experience were used to design the website. This is not a linear process - each plane was considered and developed throughout development.

## Strategy

Based on the Code Institute Hackathon August 2024 Theme of "Pixel Pioneers", the goal of this platform is to:
- Make a retro game complete with 8 bit sound effects and music.
- Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JS game framework such as Three.js.

Following an initial brainstorm of possible games, a plan-view racing game concept was chosen, similar to the original Micro-Machines video game, developed by Codemasters for the NES.

Needs of users were defined as user stories and managed via [GitHub Issues/Projects](https://github.com/users/alanjameschapman/projects/7).

## Scope

Once the game was chosen, existing online games were researched to help identify what would be included in the scope of the project. Possible features were identified and converted to user stories within GitHub projects.

## Structure

[Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com) was used to structure the site navigation as shown in the user flow diagram below. This was later developed into wireframes - see the Skeleton section.

![user-flow](/docs/wireframes/user-flow.svg)

## Skeleton

### Interface Design

The user flow diagram helped to develop wireframes for each page using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). A laptop-first approach was used, with subsequent layouts for larger screens developed thereafter.

#### Wireframes

**Concept Design**

A concept design was created during the brainstorming phase, showing possible track layout and game features for development.

| Page | Wireframe |
| - | - |
| Index | |
| help | |
| High Scores | |
| Race | |

### Navigation Design

Whilst developing these wireframes, it was concluded that site navigation would be best served by a navbar on each page, with the following links: home, race, settings and high scores.

## Surface

### Colour schemes

The colour scheme is based on the original Micro Machines video game cover.

<img src="https://github.com/alanjameschapman/whiteboard/raw/main/static/images/default.jpg" alt="default image" width="500"/>

The dominant colour is yellow, which promotes [positivity, attention and creativity](https://blog.hope-education.co.uk/classroom-psychology-which-colours-are-best-for-education/) in the classroom.

The [Coolors image picker](https://coolors.co/image-picker) was used to generate a colour pallette based on the primary colour yellow. The [consensus](https://whitesharkmedia.com/blog/web-tracking/choose-the-best-color-palette-for-your-website/) for website colour palettes is that in addition to white, three colours should be used - primary, seconday and accent - in a ratio of 60:30:10.

The colour combination was regenerated until the three colours generated a positive response in the author and provided suitable contrast, which was checked using [eightshapes](https://eightshapes.com/).

### Fonts

[iloveewp](https://www.ilovewp.com/resources/education/wordpress-for-schools/most-used-google-fonts-on-school-websites/) lists the "Most Used Google Fonts on School Websites". The top fonts were reviewed and Raleway was selected for its unique 'w' which would be used as the branding, navbar, footer and favicon to represent the 'w' in whiteboard:

[fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/) was used to find suitable pairing fonts. Martel Sans was chosen because it has serif and sans-serif variants for headings and paragraphs respectively. Sans-serif was chosen for paragraph text because serifs can be difficult to read on screens.

<img src="https://github.com/alanjameschapman/whiteboard/raw/main/docs/screenshots/fonts.png" alt="fonts" width="400"/>

[favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) was used to generate the favicon, based on the colour pallet.

# Features

## Implemented

### Navbar and Footer (all pages)

The navbar and footer are fixed and present on all pages and are responsive to different screen sizes, to make them visible at all times.

| Screenshot |

| <img src="https://github.com/alanjameschapman/whiteboard/raw/main/docs/features/navbar-teacher.png" alt="navbar-teacher" width="400"/> |

| Element | Description |
| - | - |
| Logo | Link to the home page |

The footer is not fixed to the bottom of the page because it is not necessary to be visible at all times.

### Register (register.html)

The register screen allows the user to register for the site. The user can enter their username, email and password, and click the register button.

### Bugs

Bugs were tracked throughout the project as GitHub issues. Links are provided to see the development notes and screenshots for each.

#### Resolved

| Issue | Problem | Screenshot | Solution | Screenshot |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| [#29](https://github.com/alanjameschapman/whiteboard/issues/29) | Edit button not populating comment box for editing | ![#29](/docs/issues/29-1.png) | Javascript amended from "id_body" to "id_content | ![#29](/docs/issues/29-2.png) |

#### Unresolved

The only unresolved bug is the password reset not working. This does not affect the website functionality because the admin can reset passwords manually.

| Issue# | Problem | Screenshot | Comment |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
[36](https://github.com/alanjameschapman/whiteboard/issues/36) | password reset not working | ![#36](/docs/issues/36-1.png) | This bug and associated [Issue#7](https://github.com/alanjameschapman/whiteboard/issues/7) for password reset moved to backlog for future development. |

### Lighthouse

The WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool was used throughout the project to check for accessibility issues. Lighthouse was then used to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the deployed site. The PWA score not showing is a [known feature](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60603960/why-lighthouse-pwa-score-is-blank-even-though-the-page-is-audited).

Page | Laptop | Desktop | Comment |

### Code Validation

#### HTML

[W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML. The Django template language cannot be validated by URI using the W3C validator, so the rendered HTML was copied and pasted into the direct input form for each page.

| Page | W3C URL | Screenshot | Notes | Pass |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| [register](/registration/signup.html) | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwhiteboard-app-742f545f1848.herokuapp.com%2Faccounts%2Fsignup%2F) | ![register](/docs/testing/register.png) | Errors relate to built-in Django form and don't affect UX or functionality. | &check; |

#### CSS

CSS was validated by direct input using [jigsaw W3C Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and validates as CSS level 3 + SVG:

<p>
    <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">
        <img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px"
            src="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss-blue"
            alt="Valid CSS!"/>
    </a>
</p>

#### JavaScript

[jshint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the only custom JavaScript file, [comments.js](/staticfiles/js/comments.js), used to edit, delete and approve comments.

| File | Screenshot | Description | Pass |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| [comments](/staticfiles/js/comments.js) | ![comments.js](/docs/testing/comments-js.png) | One warning about a function 'getCookie' declared in a loop referencing an outer scoped variable. Reviewed but syntax deemed not difficult to understand. | &check; |
